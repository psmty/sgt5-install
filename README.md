# üì¶ SGT5 Bootstrap Installer

Welcome!  
This is the **official installation wizard** for setting up the SGT5 system on your server or local environment.

This repository is designed to simplify the installation process, even for users without deep technical knowledge.

## üöÄ Installation

To begin, open your terminal and run the following command **in an empty folder**:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psmty/sgt5-install/main/install.sh)"
```

That‚Äôs it! üéâ  
The script will:

- Ask for your GitHub token to access the private installation files  
- Automatically download and prepare the system  
- Start an easy-to-follow setup wizard

> **Important:** The script might require a restart after the first run. After rebooting, simply run the script again to complete the setup.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If the installation is interrupted** for any reason (e.g. network failure, manual stop), you can safely re-run the same command.  
> Alternatively, if the environment is already prepared, you can resume the setup by running:
>
> ```bash
> sgt5 -i
> ```
> or
> ```bash
> ./start.sh -i
> ```
