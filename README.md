## üöÄ Installation

To begin, open your terminal and run the following command **in an empty folder**:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psmty/sgt5-install/main/install.sh)"
```

That‚Äôs it! üéâ
The script will:

* Ask for your GitHub token to access the private installation files
* Automatically download and prepare the system
* Start an easy-to-follow setup wizard

> **Important:** The script might require a restart after the first run. After rebooting, simply run the script again to complete the setup.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If the installation is interrupted** for any reason (e.g. network failure, manual stop), you can safely re-run the above installation command.
> Alternatively, if the environment is already prepared, you can resume the setup by running:
>
> ```bash
> sgt5 -i
> ```

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Need
